Production Code:
    NPM Settings:
        Make sure you pick the correct versions
            npm config set save=true
                No longer have to put --save for dependencies
            npm config set save-exact=true
                No longer have to put --save for dependencies and there's no ^ meaning exact version

    Environmental Variables:
        npm install -g foreman
            nf start (has a default for environmental variables)
                .env (use this file to set the defaults
                    {
                        "port": 9000,
                        "connection": {
                            "sql":"",
                            "mongo":""
                        }
                    }

    Cross Platform Concerns:
        Windows/Mac isn't case sensitive where as Linux is, recommendation is to use lowercase with - to separate words
